###In Day 01 we practice react class components.

This simple demo shows how to map a list of product objects to a list of cards that contain a title, brand, price and two buttons. The first button adds 10 to the price. The second button removes the card and the corresponding item from the product list.
The list gets saved and retrieved from the local storage. if the local storage item does not exist, the app uses a static list to demonstrate the functionality and the view.
There is an additional button to add a random product to the list.
